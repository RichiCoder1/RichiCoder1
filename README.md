# Howdy üëã

Welcome to my README! If you're reading this, I'm guessing you're hear to learn a bit about me. So let's go!

### About Me

I'm a lifelong programmer who's love is diving into new projects and ideas, and moving both developer and user experience forward constantly. This carries me forward whether in my day-to-day work on my company's product, improving the state of our internal tooling and platform, or contributing a array for OSS projects. 

### Currently Working On

Right now, my big focus is on Kubernetes and cloud native tech. Specifically making it more accessible and robust for developers. The ecosystem around k8s and many cloud native technologies is rich but often unfriendly to newcomers, or workable for platform and tooling teams but unfriendly for the rest of engineering orgs. As someone tackling this at my own company, I'd like to carry that work forward to the broader community.

### Looking for Help?

Most of my contributions go too tools that my teams interact with on a regular basis, but I'm always up to contribute however I can to projects in need (within moderation). What are some things I can help with?

#### Technologies
* .NET (Core)
* NodeJS
* Web (HTML/CSS/JS/TS)
* Go (WIP)
* Kubernetes

#### Aspects
* Public Documentation
* Contributor Documentation
* CI/CD
* Project UX
* Dev UX

**Thank you for reading! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ**
